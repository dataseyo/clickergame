# Clicker Game

Live at: [https://dataseyo.github.io/clickergame/](https://dataseyo.github.io/clickergame/)

I made this game primarily to learn state management with use context and to get experience with storing data in different ways, opting for a more simple local storage in this case instead of the MERN stack I had been using. I gained more experience with creating reusable components (e.g., the collapsable div component used to hold the training, quest, and upgrade content). I also experimented more with css and JSON. I used the later to, when the user presses a button in the training menu, generate an outcome (where the outcomes have different probabilistic weights) that affects global state (such as the stamina, or the user's stats). 

This project was meant to serve as a benchmark for my progress in learning React and javascript/html/css, measuring it against my (failed) attempt to make an [idle game](https://github.com/dataseyo/idlegame) a few months ago.
